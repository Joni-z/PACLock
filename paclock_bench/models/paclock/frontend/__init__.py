"""Frontend: raw EEG -> (band x time-patch) tokens + per-band phase/amplitude.

Redesigned after the frontend-bottleneck diagnostic (a plain conv tokenizer hit
0.88 AUROC on TUAB while the old band frontend capped at 0.79). The diagnostic
pinned the loss on two things the old frontend threw away:

  1. it mean-pooled over the 16 channels  -> spatial info gone (abnormality is
     often localized to a few electrodes);
  2. it collapsed each band's whole time course into ONE token via a
     Linear(seq_len -> hidden) -> temporal structure gone.

This version keeps both, the same way the winning conv tokenizer did, but stays
band-structured so the MI operator still has its frequency-band identity:

  * sinc bandpass per channel                       -> (B, C, n_bands, T)
  * per band, a Conv1d(C -> hidden) patch tokenizer mixes channels (learned, not
    averaged) and patchifies time -> (B, n_bands, P, hidden)
  * tokens are flattened to (B, n_bands * P, hidden) for the generic mixer
    interface; the (n_bands, P) layout is recoverable (P = N // n_bands) so the
    MI operator can still build a band x band coupling matrix.

Phase/amplitude (for the MI operator) are still exposed per band at full time
resolution, and now **per channel** rather than channel-averaged: averaging
the analytic signal across channels before taking phase/amplitude let
channels with different phase alignment or scale cancel or dilute each
other's coupling. The MI operator instead computes a coupling matrix per
channel and averages the (already-real, non-negative) |Z| scores across
channels, which cannot cancel the same way (v3 fix, see AGENT.md sec. 9.7).
