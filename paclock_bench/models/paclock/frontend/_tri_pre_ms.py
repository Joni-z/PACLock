"""v2 tri-axial frontend: raw EEG -> (electrode x band x time-patch) token GRID.

Unlike the v1 frontend (models/frontend/__init__.py), this one does NOT collapse
the channel axis -- electrodes stay an explicit token dimension so the encoder
can model space and so variable montages are possible (AGENT.md sec. 13.3).

Outputs, for x = (B, C, T):
  * tokens   : (B, C, n_bands, P, d_model)   -- the 3D token grid
  * coupling : (B, C, P, n_bands, n_bands)   -- time-resolved, per-channel MVL
               coupling (AGENT.md sec. 13.6 / 9.17 Finding 2: computed WITHIN
               each patch and per channel, never averaged over time/channels)
  * band_hz  : (n_bands, 2)  center-freq + bandwidth per band, for the band PE

The analytic-signal math (unit complex phase vector, mean-centred amplitude
debiasing, no atan2) is identical to v1 and still validated by
scripts/synth_pac_test.py; only the reduction axes change.

    ``stride == kernel_size``, evaluated as a single GEMM.

    Every tokeniser in this frontend has that shape, and it is the worst shape a
    convolution library can be handed: with one input channel the implicit-GEMM
    reduction is only ``kernel_size`` long and the output-channel dimension is 8
    or 64, so MIOpen falls back to a near-naive kernel over 4096 independent
    single-channel signals.

    Measured on the finished runs rather than guessed: ``size_large`` multiplies
    the encoder FLOPs by 5.33 and costs 7% of wall time, which puts the whole
    encoder at 1.8% of a step -- the other 98% is here, sustaining roughly 0.05%
    of the MI210 fp32 peak. The same ladder shows ``patch400`` (4x FEWER tokens)
    running SLOWER than ``patch100``, which only makes sense if the cost tracks
    the convolution kernel size rather than the token count.

    With ``stride == kernel_size`` the patches do not overlap, so the
    convolution IS a per-patch linear map, and ``(N, P, patch) @ W`` is the same
    arithmetic as one well-tuned GEMM. Mathematically identical; NOT
    bit-identical, because the two reduce over ``patch`` in a different order.
    See scripts/verify_patch_project.py.
