"""v2 tri-axial backbone: positional encodings, axis mixers, block, encoder.

The token grid is (B, C, n_bands, P, D) -- electrode x band x time-patch. Each
block mixes ONE axis at a time (AGENT.md sec. 13.5):

  time  : RoPE self-attention over P patches         (per electrode+band fiber)
  space : self-attention over C electrodes           (per band+patch)
  freq  : directional coupling operator over n_bands  (per electrode+patch)  <-- ours

Factorising the mixing is what keeps compute cheap: instead of one attention
over all C*n_bands*P tokens, each axis is O(axis_len^2) with the other two axes
folded into the batch. The frequency axis stays O(n_bands^2), constant in
sequence length.

Only the FREQUENCY-axis mixer is swapped in the ablation (coupling / attention /
cotar); time and space are always attention. base.py's "swap only the mixer"
contract now means "swap only the frequency-axis mixer" (sec. 13.8).

    coupling both support it. Either one can veto.

    Why multiplicative and why on the PROBABILITIES, not the logits: QK logits are
    signed, and multiplying a *negative* logit by a large coupling makes that pair
    *less* attended -- i.e. strong coupling would suppress the very edge it should
    promote. Post-softmax weights are non-negative, so the product is monotone in
    coupling, which is the intended semantics.

    Why no learnable scale -- this is the whole point of the design. Every previous
    attempt put the prior next to a free QK path behind a learnable knob, and the
    optimiser turned the knob off: FreqCoupling's `pac_scale` decayed monotonically
    to 0 (sec. 13.20), and FreqCoherenceGate's `gate_w` never left its 0 init at all

    normalised to mean 1, so the modulation is invariant to coupling's absolute scale
    and there is no parameter that can flatten it.

    Degenerate rows (a flat/dead electrode gives an all-zero coupling row) fall back
    to a uniform row = plain attention, rather than propagating 0/0. Dead channels in
    16-channel clinical montages are the exact failure that produced NaN across a

    """OURS: MI coupling decides the attention TOPOLOGY, not a weight on it.

    For each target band j, only the `mi_k` source bands with the strongest measured
    coupling into j may be attended at all; every other logit is -inf, so softmax
    gives them exactly zero. QK still learns freely -- but only inside the set the
    physics allows.

    This is the strictly harder version of FreqMIProduct, and the difference is a
    real one: a *multiplicative* prior can be overridden by a sufficiently confident
    QK (a near-one-hot softmax times anything, renormalised, is still that one-hot),
    whereas -inf cannot be out-voted by confidence. Running both answers whether the
    escape hatch matters.

    It also lands in the one category sec. 13.23 identified as safe from being
    optimised away -- "which tokens may attend to which" is structure, not an
    optional term beside a free path, so there is no knob to turn off. The closest
    thing already tried, FreqPhaseSteered, also uses a hard non-learnable mask
    (strict lower triangular) and is the only mixer in the project that beat every
    other on TUAB and TUEV under plain supervised training (sec. 13.12). The
    difference here: that mask is fixed for every sample, this one is recomputed per
    (electrode, patch) from that segment's own coupling.

    No self-edge is forced. topk always returns `mi_k` distinct sources, so no row can
    be fully masked (which would make softmax NaN), and the token's own content
    already survives through the block's `x = x + freq(...)` residual.

    Deliberate limitation: topk is discrete, so no gradient reaches `coupling` or the
    sinc cutoffs through this path. The frontend still gets gradient via the token
    path. Recorded here because it is a property of the design, not an oversight.

    """Ablation baseline: NO frequency axis -- band tokens never communicate.

    This is the honest 2-axis control (space + time only), i.e. the CBraMod-style
    criss-cross backbone our tri-axial design claims to improve on (AGENT.md
    sec. 13.23). It returns exactly zero so the block's `x = x + freq(...)`
    residual is a no-op; the band dimension survives as a batch dimension only.

    It doubles as a MECHANISM probe for the cf_mixed objective: with no cross-band
    path, a masked HIGH band can never see the visible LOW bands, so crossfreq
    reconstruction is unsolvable by construction. If cf_mixed's advantage over
    random MAE disappears here, that advantage is *caused* by cross-frequency
    communication rather than by the mask happening to be harder.

    Carries no parameters, so the comparison is not parameter-matched -- that is
    deliberate: the question is whether the axis buys anything, and it must beat
    the free option of not existing.
