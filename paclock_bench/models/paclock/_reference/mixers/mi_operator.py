"""OURS: the differentiable Modulation-Index (MI) token mixer.

Design (v6): **gated convex mix between token-level attention and the
band-level PAC-biased operator.**

    core_attn = MultiHeadSelfAttention(x)              # token-level  (g -> 0 end)
    core_band = v3 band-level op(x, coupling)          # band-level   (g -> 1 end)
    g         = sigmoid(MLP(coupling_statistics))      # per-(sample, band) in (0, 1)
    out       = (1 - g) * core_attn  +  g * core_band

Why this shape (AGENT.md sec. 9.17). v5 tried "attention floor + additive
gated PAC side-branch" on the theory that when PAC is useless the operator
should fall back to the attention baseline, because v3's `pac_scale -> 0`
degenerate form (a *single-head, band-level* attention on `band_repr`) was
assumed to be strictly weaker than the multi-head token-level baseline. **The
logs say that assumption is false.** On CHB-MIT, v3's `pac_scale` collapsed to
~0 by epoch 4 -- yet that run still scored 0.735 test AUROC against the
attention baseline's 0.642. The band-level bottleneck (mean-pool the P patches
per band, mix across the n_bands summaries, broadcast back) is not a
degeneracy, it is *the asset* -- a strong structural prior on noisy, heavily
imbalanced EEG. v5 demoted exactly that to an optional side branch and welded
the always-on token-level attention into the main path, which cost the ceiling
(Sleep-EDF kappa 0.5199 -> 0.5101; CHB-MIT val AUROC 0.853 -> 0.720 at epoch 0).

So the axis the data actually wants to adapt along is **band-level bottleneck
vs. token-level attention**, not "attention plus optional PAC". v6 spans both
endpoints with a convex mix:

  * `g -> 0`: `out == core_attn`, *exactly* the vanilla-attention baseline
    mixer -- the floor that TUAB/TUEV want (v5 did prove this fix works there:
    TUAB val bacc 0.8045 >= attention's 0.7959).
  * `g -> 1`: `out == core_band`, *exactly* the v3 operator, including its own
    learned per-layer `pac_scale` on the coupling bias -- the ceiling that
    Sleep-EDF / CHB-MIT want. Note `pac_scale` is kept *inside* branch B
    precisely because the two datasets use it differently (Sleep-EDF settles
    ~0.2-0.3, CHB-MIT ~0), so the operator must be able to express both.
  * in between: `g` is input-conditioned on the coupling matrix's own
    scale-invariant statistics, so the model *detects* whether real
    cross-frequency structure is present and picks the regime per band, per
    sample, per layer.

Complexity: O(N^2) in the token count N = n_bands*P via branch A (deliberate --
see AGENT.md sec. 5). Branch B stays O(n_bands^2). The coupling matrix depends
only on the frontend's phase/amplitude, so it is computed once and reused
across all layers (see `Encoder`); each block only re-does the cheap gate +
aggregation.

Coupling matrix follows Canolty (2006) MVL with Ozkurt normalisation and
mean-centred amplitude debiasing (van Driel dPAC style) -- unchanged from v3,
still validated by scripts/synth_pac_test.py.
