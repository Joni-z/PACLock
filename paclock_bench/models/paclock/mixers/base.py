"""The load-bearing contract of the repo: every token mixer is interchangeable.

The whole point of PACLock is one controlled ablation -- same backbone, same
training, swap only the token mixer between (a) self-attention, (b) CoTAR, and
(c) our MI operator. That swap stays clean only if all three obey this exact
interface (shape and dtype in == out).

    A mixer may not change ``n_bands`` or ``hidden_dim``, and may not reach back
